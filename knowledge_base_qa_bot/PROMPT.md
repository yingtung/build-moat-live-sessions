# Design a Knowledge Base Q&A Bot

## System Requirements

Build a Q&A bot over a small Markdown knowledge base:

- The repo provides sample `.md` documents in `docs/`
- The system builds an index from those documents
- The Markdown KB strategy should write an inspectable `.kb/index.json`
- The Vector RAG strategy should persist its FAISS index in `.kb/faiss_index/`
- Users ask questions through an API
- Answers must be grounded in the indexed documents
- Answers must cite sources using `filename#heading`
- If the knowledge base does not contain the answer, the system should say it cannot confirm

## Choose a Retrieval Strategy

You can solve this with either strategy:

### Strategy A: Markdown KB

```text
Markdown files -> heading sections -> section index -> BM25 keyword search -> raw Markdown context -> LLM answer
```

This is inspired by the Karpathy-style LLM knowledge base pattern: plain Markdown files, explicit indexes, and LLM-readable context instead of embeddings.

### Strategy B: Vector RAG

```text
Markdown files -> chunks -> embeddings -> vector search -> retrieved context -> LLM answer
```

This is the traditional RAG path: semantic retrieval with embeddings and a vector store.

## Design Questions

Answer these before you start coding:

1. Which retrieval strategy did you choose, and why?
    
    Ans: I choose strategy A. This is because it's used as a Q&A chatbot, so there isn't much data to deal with, and the  system will be low-maintainance.

2. What is the retrieval unit in your design: file, section, or chunk?

    Ans: Section is chosen because it provides the complete context for the subject.

3. How do you decide what goes into the prompt?

    Ans: Strictly structure the prompt to restrict LLM outputs, and assign a clear role and mission to the LLM.

4. How do you cite sources so users can inspect the original Markdown?

    Ans: It's very convenient to cite sources using anchors in Markdown.

5. What should happen when retrieval finds weak or irrelevant results?

    Ans: If no relevant information is found, the LLM should state that there are no relevant results in the database.

6. When would you switch from Markdown KB to Vector RAG?

    Ans: When the QA chatbot encounters the following issuses:
    - Multilingual users
    - Vairous data formats such as PDF, MP3, or Word files.
    - Queries without keywords


7. When would you switch from Vector RAG back to a Markdown index?

    Ans: When should we switch from Vector RAG to Markdown index.
     - Hallucination
     - Difficulty in debugging (e.g., hard to explain why two vectors are similar)
     - High maintenance and high cost

8. If the knowledge base grows from 10 files to 100,000 files, what changes?

    Ans: This data should be indexed in a search engine such as Elasticsearch.

## Verification

Before running the server, set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Both strategies use OpenAI for final answer generation. Vector RAG also uses OpenAI embeddings during `/index` and for each `/chat` query.

Your prototype should pass all of these:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# -> 200, {"status": "ok"}

# Chat before indexing
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How long do refunds take?"}'
# -> 200, should indicate the knowledge base has not been indexed yet

# Build the index from docs/*.md
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/index
# -> 200, returns {"files_indexed": N, "sections_indexed": M}

# Markdown KB only: inspect the generated section index
cat .kb/index.json

# Markdown KB only: restart the server, then ask again without POST /index
# -> should load .kb/index.json on startup

# Vector RAG only: inspect the persisted FAISS index metadata
cat .kb/faiss_index/metadata.json

# Vector RAG only: restart the server, then ask again without POST /index
# -> should load .kb/faiss_index/ on startup

# Ask a question answered by the docs
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "How long do refunds take?"}'
# -> 200, answer cites refund_policy.md#refund-timeline

# Ask another grounded question
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Can I change my email address?"}'
# -> 200, answer cites account_help.md#change-email-address

# Ask an out-of-scope question
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Which restaurants are nearby?"}'
# -> 200, answer should say it cannot confirm from the knowledge base
```

## Suggested Tech Stack

Python + FastAPI is recommended, but Challenge Track students may use any language or framework.

## Stretch Goals

Pick one or more after the core `/index` and `/chat` flow works.

### Score Threshold and Fallback

Add a retrieval score threshold. If the best sections or chunks are too weak, return an honest cannot-confirm answer instead of forcing a citation.

### Streaming Interface

After `/chat` works, add:

```text
POST /chat/stream
```

Use SSE to stream the answer token by token. A good streaming response should:

- Return selected sources first, so users can see what context the bot is using
- Stream answer tokens as they arrive
- End with a clear `done` event
- Preserve the same grounding and citation rules as `/chat`

Optional UI challenge: build a tiny HTML page that calls `/chat/stream` and renders the answer incrementally.

### Browser UI

Build a tiny browser UI over `/chat` or `/chat/stream`. Show selected sources before the answer so users can inspect grounding.

### Multi-Format Import

Add a small normalization pipeline before indexing:

```text
raw/*.txt or raw/*.html -> docs/*.md -> POST /index -> retrieval index
```

Requirements:

- Keep Markdown as the canonical knowledge format
- Preserve the original source filename
- Convert headings into Markdown headings
- Rebuild the retrieval index after import

Start with `.txt` or `.html`. More complex formats such as PDFs, spreadsheets, and transcripts can be discussed as production extensions.

### Alternative Interfaces

Expose the same retrieval core through another interface:

```text
CLI: kb index / kb ask
MCP: expose index, search, and chat as agent tools
Web UI: simple chat screen over /chat or /chat/stream
```

The goal is to compare interface tradeoffs, not to change the retrieval design.

### Wiki Index Generation

Generate `wiki/index.md` from `.kb/index.json` so humans and agents can browse the available topics.

### Answer Filing

Write useful Q&A results back into `wiki/` after review. Preserve citations back to the source Markdown sections.

### Conversation Memory

Add short conversation memory for follow-up questions. Memory can help interpret the query, but retrieved sources must still control the final answer.

### Paraphrase Comparison

Create paraphrased queries and compare Markdown KB vs Vector RAG. Look for synonym misses, semantic false positives, and citation quality.
